### 8.1 Process Identifiers
Every process has a unique process ID, a non-negative integer.

Although unique, process IDs are reused. As processes terminate, their IDs become candidates for reuse. Most UNIX systems implement algorithms to delay reuse, however, so that newly created processes are assigned IDs different from those used by processes that terminated recently.

In addition to the process ID, there are other identifiers for every process. The
following functions return these identifiers.
```c
#include <unistd.h>
pid_t getpid(void);
Returns: process ID of calling process
pid_t getppid(void);
Returns: parent process ID of calling process
uid_t getuid(void);
Returns: real user ID of calling process
uid_t geteuid(void);
Returns: effective user ID of calling process
gid_t getgid(void);
Returns: real group ID of calling process
gid_t getegid(void);
Returns: effective group ID of calling process
```

### 8.3 fork Function
An existing process can create a new one by calling the fork function.
```c
#include <unistd.h>
pid_t fork(void);
Returns: 0 in child, process ID of child in parent, âˆ’1 on error
```
