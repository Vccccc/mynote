## Preposition
### What is a preposition?
**A preposition is a word used to link nouns, pronouns, or phrases to other words within a sentence.** they act to connect the people, objects, time and positions of a sentence. **Prepositions are usually short words, and they are normally placed directly in front of nouns. In some cases, you'll find preposition in front of gerund verbs.**

There are two very important rules to remember when using propositions.
- The first rule is that make sentences clear, specific prepositions are needed. For example, the preposition **in** means one thing and the preposition **on** cannot substitute for it at all cases. Some prepositions are interchangeable but not always.


### Type of Prepositions
there are three types of prepositions, including time prepositions, place prepositions, and direction prepositions.
**Time prepositions** are those such as *before*, *after*, *during*, and *until*;
**Place prepositions** are those indicating position, such as *around*, *between*, and *against*;
**Direction prepositons** are those indicative of direction, such as *cross*, *up*, and *down*.

#### Prepositions of Time
Base examples of time prepositions include: *at*, *on*, *in*, *before*, and *after*. They are used to help indicate when something happened, happens, or will happen. It can get a little confusing though, as many different prepositions can be used.

For example:
- I was born **on** July 4th, 1982.
- I was born **in** 1982.
- I was born **at** exactly 2am.
- I was born two minutes **before** my twin brother.
- I was born **after** the Great War ended.

The above makes it seem quite difficult, with five different prepositions used to indicate when something happened. However, there is a set of guidelines that can help decide which preposition to use:

For years, months, seasons, centuries and times of day, use the preposition **in**:
- I first met Join **in** 1987.
- It's always cold **in** January.
- Easter fall **in** spring each year.
- The Second World War occurred **in** the 20th century.
- We eat breakfast **in** the morning.

For days, times and specific holiday days, use the preposition **on**:
- We go to school **on** Monday, but not **on** Sunday.
- Christmas is **on** December 25th.
- Buy me a present **on** my birthday.

For times, indicators of exception and festivals, use the preposition **at**:
- Families often argue **at** Christmas Time.
- I work faster **at** night.
- Her shift finished **at** 7pm.

*Before* and *after* should be much easier to understand than the other examples of prepositions of time. Both are used to explain when something happened, happens or will happen, but specifically in relation to another thing.
- **before** I discovered this bar, I used to go home **after** work.
- We will not leave **before** 3pm
- David comes **before** Bryan in the line, but **after** Louise.

Other prepositions of time could include: *During*, *about*, *around*, *until* and *throughout*.
- The concert will be staged **throughout** the month of May.
- I learned how to ski **during** the holidays.
- He usually arrives **around** 3pm.
- It was **about** six in the morning when we make it to bed.
- The store is open **until** midnight.


#### Prepositions of Place
To confuse matters a bit, the most common prepositions of time -**on**, **at**, **in**-are also the most common prepositions to indicate position. However, the rules are a little clearer as place prepositions are a more rigit concept than time prepositions.
- The cat is **on** the table.
- The dogs are **in** the kennel.
- We can met **at** the crossroads.

The guidelines can be broken down as follows:
**On** is used when referring something with a surface.
- The sculpture hangs **on** the wall.
- The images are **on** the page.
- The specials are **on** the menu, which is **on** the table.

**In** is used when referring something that is inside or within confined boundaries. This could be anything, even a country:
- Jim is **in** France, visiting his aunt **in** the hosptial.
- The whiskey is **in** the jar **in** the fridge.
- The girls play **in** the garden.

**At** is used when referring to something at a specific point:
- The boys are **at** the entrance **at** the movie theater.
- He stood **at** bus stop **at** the corner of Water and High streets.
- We will meet **at** the airport.

Lot's of other prepositions of place, such as *under*, *over*, *inside*, *outsied*, *above* and *below* are used in English. There is, however, a lot less confusion as they refer to rigid positions rather than abstract ones.
- The cat is **under** the table.
- Put the sandwich **over** there.
- The key is locked **inside** the car.
- They stepped **outside** the house.
- Major is ranked **above** corporal.
- He is waving at you from **below** the stairs.


#### Prepositions of Movement
Essentially, they describe how something or someone moves from one place to another. The most commonly used preposition of movement is **to**, which usually serves to highlight that there is movement towards a specific destination.

- He has gone on vocation **to** France.
- She went **to** the bowling alley every Friday last summer.
- I will go to bed when I am tired.
- They will go to the zoo if they finish their errands.

Other more specific prepositions of movement include: *through*, *across*, *off*, *down* and *into*. These prepositions can sometimes get mixed up with others. while they are similar, they hav individual meanings that add context to the movement.
