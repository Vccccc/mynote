## Preposition
### What is a preposition?
**A preposition is a word used to link nouns, pronouns, or phrases to other words within a sentence.** they act to connect the people, objects, time and positions of a sentence. **Prepositions are usually short words, and they are normally placed directly in front of nouns. In some cases, you'll find preposition in front of gerund verbs.**

There are two very important rules to remember when using propositions.
- The first rule is that make sentences clear, specific prepositions are needed. For example, the preposition **in** means one thing and the preposition **on** cannot substitute for it at all cases. Some prepositions are interchangeable but not always.
